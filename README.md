# geoportal-server-harvester
As part of the evolution of Geoportal Server, the harvesting capability has been separated into its own module. This is because there are use cases where the harvesting can be used as a stand-alone broker between catalogs of content. 

This repository thus contains the harvesting capability, while it's sibling [geoportal-server-catalog](https://github.com/Esri/geoportal-server-catalog) is the new catalog of Geoportal Server.

## Limiting the Harvester's Reach

The nature of the Harvester application is, as the name suggests, to harvest metadata from whatever web endpoints it is provided. The list(s) of endpoints to download metadata from can also be provided by external entities over the internet. Neither the metadata being harvested nor the list(s) of endpoints provided by external entities are vetted or checked by the Harvester. **Users who wish to limit the scope of the Harvester's reach should configure the network or machine where the Harvester is located with allow lists or deny lists of web endpoints to prevent the Harvester from reaching undesirable locations.**
